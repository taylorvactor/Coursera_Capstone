My family and I have been considering moving back to Pittsburgh, PA from Austin, TX, but we really love our current neighborhood in Austin.  We love that we're technically in the suburbs and have space in our house and neighborhood, parks and green space, good schools and crime is very low.  We also enjoy the fact that we are very close to downtown (~8 miles) and south Austin (~8 miles) and have easy access to the multitude of amenities that these parts of town offer.  These include:  great restaurants, music venues, eclectic shops, coffee houses, etc.  We'd love to find a neighborhood in Pittsburgh that has similar proximal amenities to our current neighborhood, so that we could move closer to our extended families and really enjoy where we live.
