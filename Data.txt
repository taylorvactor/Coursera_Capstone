I will be primarily using Foursquare's location data and Pittsburgh neighborhood data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center to solve this problem.  I'll download the Pittsburgh neighborhood data as a JSON file and retrieve the neighborhood coordinates.  I'll then run those, as well as my neighborhood's coordinates, through Foursquare's API and see what type of venues are nearby.  It will consider such venues as parks, restaurants, coffee shops, stores, music venutes, etc.  That will then allow me to cluster neighborhoods with a similar assortment of amenities and hopefully find ones in Pittsburgh that are comparable to mine in Austin.
